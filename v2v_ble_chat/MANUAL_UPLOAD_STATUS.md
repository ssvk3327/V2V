## 📤 **Manual Upload Features**

### **🎯 User Interface Updates**
```
AI Detection Button:
- Shows "🔄 Processing Image..." during upload
- Disabled during processing to prevent multiple uploads
- Progress indicator with spinning animation
- Automatic re-enable after completion

Dialog Options:
- "📷 Camera Upload" - Take photo and upload to backend
- "🖼️ Gallery Upload" - Select image and upload to backend
- "🕳️ Test Pothole (Backend)" - Test with backend API
- "🚧 Test Speed Breaker (Backend)" - Test with backend API
```

### **📊 Upload Process Flow**
```
1. User selects image source (camera/gallery)
2. Image captured/selected from device
3. "System: 📤 Uploading image to backend for processing..."
4. Progress updates: "System: 📊 Processing... 20%/40%/60%/80%"
5. Backend processes with Roboflow API + distance calculation
6. "System: 🤖 Backend AI: X hazard(s) found (nearest: X.Xm)"
7. "System: 📡 Source: backend_api"
8. Visual results screen with distance-labeled bounding boxes
9. "System: 📡 V2V Alert sent: [alert message with distance]"
```

## 🔧 **Backend API Integration**

### **✅ HTTP Client Service**
```
BackendApiService Features:
- Base64 image encoding for upload
- Progress tracking with callbacks
- Health check monitoring
- Automatic fallback to direct API
- Error handling and retry logic
- JSON request/response format
```

### **✅ API Endpoints**
```
POST /process-image:
- Accepts base64 encoded images
- Returns detection results with distance
- Includes bounding box coordinates
- Provides confidence scores

POST /test-detection:
- Predefined test results
- Pothole: 2 detections at 1.1m and 1.2m
- Speed breaker: 1 detection at 2.7m
- Instant response for testing

GET /health:
- Service status check
- Feature availability confirmation
- Response time monitoring
```

## 🎯 **Expected Demo Results**

### **📷 Camera Upload Demo**
```
User Action: Tap "📷 Camera Upload"
Expected Flow:
1. Camera opens for photo capture
2. User takes photo of road with hazards
3. Upload progress: 0% → 20% → 40% → 60% → 80% → 100%
4. Backend processes image through Roboflow API
5. Distance calculation performed on detected objects
6. Results: "🤖 Backend AI: X hazard(s) found (nearest: X.Xm)"
7. Visual screen shows image with distance-labeled bounding boxes
8. V2V alert: "🕳️ Pothole detected X.X m ahead - Reduce speed"
```

### **🖼️ Gallery Upload Demo**
```
User Action: Tap "🖼️ Gallery Upload"
Expected Flow:
1. Gallery picker opens
2. User selects existing road image
3. Upload and processing with progress tracking
4. Backend analysis with distance calculation
5. Visual results with bounding boxes
6. Automatic V2V alert transmission
```

### **🧪 Backend Test Demo**
```
User Action: Tap "🕳️ Test Pothole (Backend)"
Expected Results:
- "System: 🧪 Testing pothole detection with backend..."
- "System: 🤖 Backend Test: 2 pothole(s) found (nearest: 1.1m)"
- Visual results with test image
- Bounding boxes: "🕳️ potholes 81% (1.1 m)" and "🕳️ potholes 70% (1.2 m)"
- V2V alert: "🕳️ Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead - Reduce speed"
```

---

## 🔄 **Fallback System**

### **✅ Backend Unavailable Handling**
```
If Backend Not Responding:
1. Health check fails
2. "System: ⚠️ Backend unavailable - Using direct API processing..."
3. Automatic fallback to ImageDetectionService
4. Direct Roboflow API processing
5. Results marked as "source: direct_api_fallback"
6. User experience remains seamless
```

### **✅ Error Recovery**
```
Upload Error Scenarios:
- Network timeout → Retry with direct API
- Backend error → Fallback processing
- Invalid image → User-friendly error message
- API limit reached → Graceful degradation
- Connection lost → Automatic retry logic
```

---

## 🎮 **Complete Demo Workflow**

### **Step 1: System Verification**
```
✅ Flask Backend: http://localhost:5000/health returns 200 OK
✅ WebSocket Server: localhost:8080 accepting connections
✅ Flutter App: Running with manual upload features
✅ Emulators: Both vehicles operational
```

### **Step 2: Manual Upload Test**
```
1. Connect vehicles (range ≤ 100m)
2. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" button
3. Select "📷 Camera Upload" or "🖼️ Gallery Upload"
4. Upload image and watch progress tracking
5. View backend processing results
6. See visual detection with distance labels
7. Confirm V2V alert transmission
```

### **Step 3: Backend API Test**
```
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection"
2. Select "🕳️ Test Pothole (Backend)"
3. Watch backend test processing
4. See predefined results: 2 potholes at 1.1m and 1.2m
5. View visual results with distance-labeled bounding boxes
6. Confirm V2V alert: "🕳️ Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead - Reduce speed"
```
