## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **✅ Custom Painter for Bounding Boxes**
- **Image Rendering**: Displays original image at correct aspect ratio
- **Coordinate Conversion**: Converts API coordinates to screen coordinates
- **Box Drawing**: Draws colored rectangles around detected hazards
- **Label Rendering**: Shows confidence and type with emoji icons

### **✅ Detection Coordinate System**
```
API Returns: Center-based coordinates (x, y, width, height)
Conversion: Center → Top-left corner for drawing
Scaling: API coordinates → Screen coordinates
Result: Accurate bounding boxes on displayed image
```

### **✅ Color Coding System**
```
Pothole Detection → Red boxes (🔴)
Speed Breaker Detection → Orange boxes (🟠)
Other Hazards → Yellow boxes (🟡)
Labels → White text on colored background
```
