# V2V Safety Communication - Requirements Implementation

## ✅ **Your Main Requirements Achieved**

### 🎯 **Primary Objective**
> "Establish connection with 2 devices named Vehicle A, Vehicle B within a range of 100m with a physical button to connect to each other."

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

## 📱 **Device Identification**

### **Vehicle A (emulator-5554)**
- **App Title**: "Vehicle A - V2V Safety"
- **Connection Display**: [Vehicle A] ↔ [Vehicle B]
- **Always assigned to first emulator to connect**

### **Vehicle B (emulator-5556)**
- **App Title**: "Vehicle B - V2V Safety"  
- **Connection Display**: [Vehicle A] ↔ [Vehicle B]
- **Always assigned to second emulator to connect**

---

## 🔘 **Physical Connection Button**

### **Connect Button (Green)**
- **Appears when**: Vehicle online, other vehicle in range (≤100m), not connected
- **Action**: Sends connection request to other vehicle
- **UI**: 🔗 "Connect" button

### **Disconnect Button (Red)**
- **Appears when**: Vehicles are manually connected
- **Action**: Disconnects from other vehicle
- **UI**: 🔗 "Disconnect" button

---

## 📏 **100m Range Enforcement**

### **Range Calculation**
- **Real-time simulation**: Distance changes every 3 seconds (20m-150m)
- **Connection limit**: Strictly enforced at 100m
- **Visual feedback**: Range display shows current distance

### **Range-Based Behavior**
| Distance | Connection Status | Button State | Safety Alerts |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| ≤ 100m | ✅ Can connect | 🟢 Enabled | 🟢 Work when connected |
| > 100m | ❌ Auto-disconnect | ⚫ Disabled | ❌ Blocked |

## 🚨 **Safety Features (Connected Vehicles Only)**

### **Safety Alert Buttons**
- **🕳️ Pothole Alert**: Orange button - "Pothole Ahead"
- **🚧 Speed Breaker Alert**: Amber button - "Speed Breaker Ahead"  
- **🚨 Accident Alert**: Red button - "Accident Reported"

### **Button States**
- **When NOT connected**: 🔘 GRAY (disabled)
- **When connected & in range**: 🟠🟡🔴 COLORED (enabled)
- **When out of range**: 🔘 GRAY (disabled)

### **Alert Requirements**
```
Safety alerts ONLY work when:
✅ Vehicles are manually connected AND
✅ Distance is ≤ 100m AND  
✅ Both vehicles are online
```

## 🔄 **Connection Flow**

### **Step 1: Initialization**
```
Vehicle A: "Initializing... - V2V Safety"
Vehicle B: "Initializing... - V2V Safety"
```

### **Step 2: Server Assignment**
```
Vehicle A: "Vehicle A - V2V Safety"
Vehicle B: "Vehicle B - V2V Safety"
```

### **Step 3: Range Detection**
```
Both: "Other vehicle in range (67m) - Press Connect to establish connection"
Status: [Vehicle A] ⚬ [Not Connected]
```

### **Step 4: Manual Connection**
```
User taps Connect → "Attempting to connect to other vehicle..."
Other vehicle: "Connected to Vehicle A successfully!"
Confirmation: "Connection confirmed by Vehicle B!"
Status: [Vehicle A] ↔ [Vehicle B]
```

### **Step 5: Safety Communication**
```
Safety buttons: 🟢 ENABLED
Alert sent: "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle A: 🕳️ Pothole ahead - Reduce speed"
```

## 🚀 **How to Run**

### **Method 1: Manual Start**
1. Start server: `node server.js`
2. Start Vehicle A: `flutter run -d emulator-5554`
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Start Vehicle B: `flutter run -d emulator-5556`

### **Method 2: Automated Start**
```bash
.\start_demo.bat
```

## 🎯 **Demo Script**

```
"This demonstrates Vehicle-to-Vehicle safety communication"

→ Show titles: "Vehicle A and Vehicle B are identified"
→ Show status: "They're 67 meters apart - within 100m range"
→ Show buttons: "Safety alerts are disabled - not connected yet"
→ Tap Connect: "Press the Connect button to establish connection"
→ Show connection: "Now they're connected - see the green link icon"
→ Test safety: "Safety alerts now work - Vehicle A warns Vehicle B"
→ Show range: "As distance increases beyond 100m..."
→ Show disconnect: "Connection automatically lost - safety disabled"
→ Show reconnect: "Back in range - can reconnect manually"
```
