# 🤖 V2V Safety Communication with AI Hazard Detection

## 🎯 **New AI Features Added**

### **🔍 Roboflow AI Integration**
- **API**: Navrachana University pothole and speed breaker detection model
- **Confidence Threshold**: 40% minimum for reliable detection
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes images and generates safety alerts automatically

### **📸 Image Sources**
1. **Camera Capture**: Take live photos of road conditions
2. **Gallery Selection**: Analyze existing images from device storage
3. **Test Mode**: Analyze sample pothole image (2 potholes detected at 80.6% confidence)

---

## 🚀 **How AI Detection Works**

### **Step 1: Image Capture**
```
User taps "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" button
→ Choose: Camera | Gallery | Test AI
→ Image captured/selected
```

### **Step 2: AI Analysis**
```
Image sent to Roboflow API
→ AI model analyzes road conditions
→ Detects: Potholes, Speed Breakers, Other Hazards
→ Returns confidence scores and locations
```

### **Step 3: Automatic Alert Generation**
```
If hazards detected (>40% confidence):
→ Generate appropriate safety alert
→ Send to connected vehicles (if in range)
→ Display local notification

Alert Types:
🕳️ "Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed"
🚧 "Speed breaker detected ahead - Slow down"  
⚠️ "Road hazard detected ahead - Proceed with caution"
```

## 📱 **Updated User Interface**

### **New AI Detection Button**
- **Location**: Below manual safety alert buttons
- **Color**: Purple background with camera icon
- **Function**: Opens image source selection dialog

### **Enhanced Message Display**
- **AI Analysis Messages**: 
  - `🤖 AI Detection: 2 hazard(s) found (81% confidence)`
  - `✅ AI Analysis: Road clear - No hazards detected`
  - `❌ Image analysis failed: [error details]`

### **Automatic Alert Flow**
```
AI detects hazard → Generates alert → Checks connection status:
✅ Connected & In Range: Sends alert to other vehicle
❌ Not Connected: Shows local warning only
❌ Out of Range: Shows "not transmitted" message
```

## 🧪 **Testing the AI Features**

### **Test 1: Sample Image Analysis**
```bash
# Run Python test script
python test_roboflow_api.py

Expected Result:
✅ 2 potholes detected (80.6% and 70.2% confidence)
🕳️ "Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed"
```

### **Test 2: Flutter App Integration**
```
1. Start both Vehicle A and Vehicle B
2. Connect vehicles manually
3. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection"
4. Select "Test AI"
5. Watch automatic alert generation and transmission
```

### **Test 3: Live Camera Detection**
```
1. Ensure vehicles are connected
2. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" → "Camera"
3. Take photo of road with potholes/speed breakers
4. Watch AI analysis and automatic alert
```

## 🎯 **Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: AI Detects Pothole**
```
Vehicle A: Takes photo of road with pothole
AI Analysis: "🤖 AI Detection: 1 hazard(s) found (85% confidence)"
Auto Alert: "🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed"
Vehicle B: Receives "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle A: 🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed"
```

### **Scenario 2: AI Detects Speed Breaker**
```
Vehicle B: Selects image from gallery showing speed breaker
AI Analysis: "🤖 AI Detection: 1 hazard(s) found (92% confidence)"
Auto Alert: "🚧 Speed breaker detected ahead - Slow down"
Vehicle A: Receives alert if connected and in range
```

### **Scenario 3: No Hazards Detected**
```
Vehicle A: Takes photo of clear road
AI Analysis: "✅ AI Analysis: Road clear - No hazards detected"
Result: No alert sent, road confirmed safe
```
