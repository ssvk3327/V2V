# 🔗 Vehicle Connection Guide - 100m Range

## 🎯 **How to Connect Both Vehicles Within 100m Range**

### ✅ **Current System Status**
- ✅ **WebSocket Server**: Running on localhost:8080
- ✅ **Vehicle A**: Running on emulator-5554
- ✅ **Vehicle B**: Running on emulator-5556
- ✅ **Range Simulation**: Active (20-150m dynamic range)
- ✅ **Connection Logic**: 100m maximum range enforced

---

## 📱 **Step-by-Step Connection Process**

### **Step 1: Wait for Both Apps to Load**
```
Vehicle A (emulator-5554):
- Title should show: "Vehicle A - V2V Safety"
- Status: "Vehicle A - Searching for nearby vehicles..."
- Range indicator: Shows current distance (e.g., "67m")

Vehicle B (emulator-5556):
- Title should show: "Vehicle B - V2V Safety"  
- Status: "Vehicle B - Searching for nearby vehicles..."
- Range indicator: Shows current distance (e.g., "67m")
```

### **Step 2: Monitor Range Simulation**
```
Both vehicles will show dynamic range updates every 3 seconds:
- Range changes between 20-150 meters automatically
- Messages appear: "System: Other vehicle in range (XXm) - Press Connect to establish connection"
- Wait for range to be ≤ 100m for connection to be possible
```

### **Step 3: Watch for Connection Opportunity**
```
When range ≤ 100m, you'll see:
- Green "Connect" button becomes enabled
- Message: "System: Other vehicle in range (XXm) - Press Connect to establish connection"
- Range indicator shows distance ≤ 100m (e.g., "87m", "45m", "92m")
```

### **Step 4: Initiate Connection**
```
On either Vehicle A or Vehicle B:
1. Wait for range to show ≤ 100m
2. Tap the green "🔗 Connect" button
3. Watch for connection messages
```

### **Step 5: Connection Confirmation**
```
Expected message flow:
Vehicle A: "System: Sending connection request to Vehicle B..."
Vehicle B: "System: Connection request from Vehicle A - Accepting..."
Vehicle A: "System: Connection confirmed by Vehicle B!"
Vehicle B: "System: Connected to Vehicle A successfully!"

Both vehicles will show:
- Status: "Connected to [Other Vehicle]"
- Green connection indicator
- Safety alert buttons become enabled
```

## 🎮 **Real-Time Connection Demo**

### **🔄 Range Simulation Behavior**
```
Every 3 seconds, range updates automatically:
- Range 45m → "System: Other vehicle in range (45m) - Press Connect"
- Range 67m → "System: Other vehicle in range (67m) - Press Connect"  
- Range 89m → "System: Other vehicle in range (89m) - Press Connect"
- Range 112m → "System: Other vehicle out of range (112m)"
- Range 78m → "System: Other vehicle in range (78m) - Press Connect"
```

### **✅ Connection Window**
```
Connection is possible when:
- Range ≤ 100m ✅
- Both vehicles are online ✅
- Neither vehicle is already connected ✅
- Green "Connect" button is enabled ✅
```

### **❌ Connection Blocked When**
```
Connection fails when:
- Range > 100m ❌ "Connection failed - Out of range"
- Already connected ❌ "Connection failed - Already connected"
- Server disconnected ❌ "Connection failed - Network error"
```

## 🎯 **Expected Connection Messages**

### **Successful Connection Sequence**
```
1. Vehicle A: "System: Other vehicle in range (87m) - Press Connect to establish connection"
2. [User taps Connect on Vehicle A]
3. Vehicle A: "System: Sending connection request to Vehicle B..."
4. Vehicle B: "System: Connection request from Vehicle A - Accepting..."
5. Vehicle A: "System: Connection confirmed by Vehicle B!"
6. Vehicle B: "System: Connected to Vehicle A successfully!"
7. Both: Status changes to "Connected to [Other Vehicle]"
```

### **Range-Based Status Updates**
```
When Connected and In Range:
- "System: Connected to Vehicle B: 67m - Signal: Good"
- "System: Connected to Vehicle A: 45m - Signal: Excellent"
- "System: Connected to Vehicle B: 89m - Signal: Poor"

When Connected but Out of Range:
- "System: Vehicle B moved out of range (112m) - Connection lost"
- Status changes back to "Searching for nearby vehicles..."
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Connection Issues**

### **If Connect Button is Disabled**
```
Check:
- Range must be ≤ 100m
- Both vehicles must be online
- Neither vehicle should be already connected
- WebSocket server must be running
```

### **If Connection Fails**
```
Common causes:
- Range > 100m: Wait for vehicles to get closer
- Already connected: Disconnect first, then reconnect
- Server issues: Check WebSocket server is running on port 8080
- Network issues: Restart both apps
```

### **If Range Doesn't Update**
```
Solutions:
- Wait 3 seconds for automatic range updates
- Check both apps are fully loaded
- Restart apps if range is stuck
- Verify WebSocket server is running
```

## 🎉 **After Successful Connection**

### **✅ Available Features**
```
Once connected within 100m range:
- 🕳️ Pothole Alert → Sends to other vehicle
- 🚧 Speed Breaker Alert → Sends to other vehicle  
- 🚨 Emergency Alert → Sends to other vehicle
- 🤖 AI Hazard Detection → Automatic alerts with distance
- 💬 Text Messages → Real-time chat
```

### **🎯 Test Distance-Aware AI Detection**
```
After connection:
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" (purple button)
2. Select "🕳️ Test Pothole" → Shows "1.1 m ahead"
3. Select "🚧 Test Speed Breaker" → Shows "2.7 m ahead"
4. Watch automatic V2V alerts with distance information
5. See visual detection results with bounding boxes
