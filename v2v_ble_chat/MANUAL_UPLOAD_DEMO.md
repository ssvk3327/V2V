## 📱 **Manual Upload User Experience**

### **🎮 Updated AI Detection Dialog**
```
🤖 AI Hazard Detection with Backend
Choose image source for road hazard analysis:

📡 Images will be processed through backend API with distance calculation

📷 Camera Upload          - Take photo and upload to backend
🖼️ Gallery Upload         - Select image and upload to backend  
🕳️ Test Pothole (Backend) - Test with backend API
🚧 Test Speed Breaker (Backend) - Test with backend API
```

### **📤 Upload Process Flow**
```
Step 1: User selects image source
Step 2: Image captured/selected from gallery
Step 3: Upload to backend with progress tracking
Step 4: Backend processes with Roboflow API
Step 5: Distance calculation performed
Step 6: Results returned to Flutter app
Step 7: Visual detection results displayed
Step 8: V2V alert transmitted if connected
```

3. "System: 📊 Processing... 40%"
4. "System: 📊 Processing... 60%"
5. "System: 📊 Processing... 80%"
6. "System: 🤖 Backend AI: 2 hazard(s) found (nearest: 1.1m)"
7. "System: 📡 Source: backend_api"
8. Visual results screen opens with distance-labeled bounding boxes
9. "System: 📡 V2V Alert sent: 🕳️ Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead - Reduce speed"
```

### **🖼️ Gallery Upload Demo**
```
User Action: Tap "🖼️ Gallery Upload"
System Flow:
1. Gallery picker opens
2. User selects road image with hazards
3. "System: 📤 Uploading image to backend for processing..."
4. Progress tracking with percentage updates
5. Backend processes image through Roboflow API
6. Distance calculation performed on detected objects
7. Results displayed with visual bounding boxes
8. Automatic V2V alert transmission
```

### **🧪 Backend Test Demo**
```
User Action: Tap "🕳️ Test Pothole (Backend)"
System Flow:
1. "System: 🧪 Testing pothole detection with backend..."
2. Backend returns predefined test results
3. "System: 🤖 Backend Test: 2 pothole(s) found (nearest: 1.1m)"

## 🔄 **Fallback System**

### **✅ Backend Unavailable Handling**
```
If Backend Not Available:
1. "System: ⚠️ Backend unavailable - Using direct API processing..."
2. Automatic fallback to direct Roboflow API
3. Processing continues with distance calculation
4. Results displayed normally
5. Source indicated as "direct_api_fallback"
```

### **✅ Error Recovery**
```
If Upload Fails:
1. "System: ❌ Backend processing failed: [error]"
2. "System: 🔄 Trying direct API fallback..."
3. Seamless transition to direct processing
4. User experience remains smooth
5. No data loss or interruption
```
