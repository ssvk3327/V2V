## 📱 **Demo Workflow - Distance-Aware V2V Communication**

### **Step 1: Vehicle Connection Setup**
```
Vehicle A (emulator-5554):
- Wait for app to load completely
- Check status: "Vehicle A - Searching for nearby vehicles..."
- Range indicator should show distance to Vehicle B

Vehicle B (emulator-5556):  
- Wait for app to load completely
- Check status: "Vehicle B - Searching for nearby vehicles..."
- Range indicator should show distance to Vehicle A
```

### **Step 2: Establish V2V Connection**
```
On either vehicle:
1. Wait for range to show ≤ 100m (simulated proximity)
2. Tap green "Connect" button when available
3. Confirm connection status changes to "Connected"
4. Both vehicles should show "Connected to [Other Vehicle]"
```

### **Step 3: Test Distance-Aware Pothole Detection**
```
On Vehicle A:
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" (purple button)
2. Select "🕳️ Test Pothole"
3. Watch analysis: "📸 Analyzing image for hazards..."
4. See result: "🤖 AI Detection: 2 hazard(s) found (81% confidence)"
5. Visual results screen opens automatically

Expected Visual Results:
📸 Your abc.jpeg pothole image displayed with:
🔴 Red box: "🕳️ potholes 81% (1.1 m)"
🔴 Red box: "🕳️ potholes 70% (1.2 m)"

🎯 Detection Summary:
"🕳️ Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead - Reduce speed"
Confidence: 81% | Detections: 2 | Nearest: 1.1 m

On Vehicle B (automatically):
Receives alert: "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle A: 🕳️ Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead - Reduce speed"
```

### **Step 4: Test Distance-Aware Speed Breaker Detection**
```
On Vehicle B:
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" (purple button)
2. Select "🚧 Test Speed Breaker"
3. Watch analysis: "📸 Analyzing image for hazards..."
4. See result: "🤖 AI Detection: 1 hazard(s) found (57% confidence)"
5. Visual results screen opens automatically

Expected Visual Results:
📸 Your speed breaker image displayed with:
🟠 Orange box: "🚧 broken road 57% (2.7 m)"

🎯 Detection Summary:
"🚧 Speed breaker detected 2.7 m ahead - Slow down"
Confidence: 57% | Detections: 1 | Nearest: 2.7 m

On Vehicle A (automatically):
Receives alert: "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle B: 🚧 Speed breaker detected 2.7 m ahead - Slow down"
```

### **Step 5: Test Live Image Upload**
```
On either vehicle:
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection"
2. Select "📷 Camera" or "🖼️ Gallery"
3. Upload any road image with hazards
4. Watch real-time AI analysis with distance calculation
5. See visual results with bounding boxes and distances
6. Automatic V2V alert transmission to connected vehicle
```

## 🎮 **Interactive Demo Features**

### **🔄 Real-Time V2V Communication**
```
Bidirectional Communication:
Vehicle A ↔️ WebSocket Server ↔️ Vehicle B

Message Flow:
1. Vehicle A detects hazard with distance
2. Sends to WebSocket server
3. Server broadcasts to Vehicle B
4. Vehicle B receives distance-aware alert
5. Both vehicles maintain chat history
```

### **📏 Distance Calculation Display**
```
Visual Elements:
- Bounding box labels show distance: "🕳️ potholes 81% (1.1 m)"
- Summary shows nearest distance: "Nearest: 1.1 m"
- Detail breakdown shows individual distances
- V2V alerts include distance: "Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead"
```

### **🎯 Smart Hazard Prioritization**
```
Detection Logic:
1. Calculate distance for each detected hazard
2. Sort by distance (nearest first)
3. Generate alert for nearest hazard
4. Include distance in V2V transmission
5. Display all detections with individual distances
```
