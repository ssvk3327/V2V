## 📱 **Expected User Interface**

### **Vehicle A (emulator-5554)**
```
Title: "Vehicle A - V2V Safety"
Status: [Vehicle A] ⚬ [Not Connected]
Range: ~67m | Status: Online - Not Connected
Buttons: 
  🟢 Connect (when in range)
  🟣 🤖 AI Hazard Detection
  🔘 Safety Alerts (🕳️🚧🚨)
```

### **Vehicle B (emulator-5556)**
```
Title: "Vehicle B - V2V Safety"  
Status: [Vehicle B] ⚬ [Not Connected]
Range: ~67m | Status: Online - Not Connected

## 🎮 **Demo Workflow Ready**

### **Step 1: Verify Apps Loaded**
- Wait for both emulators to show the V2V Safety app
- Check titles display "Vehicle A" and "Vehicle B"
- Confirm range shows ~67m (in communication range)

### **Step 2: Manual Connection**
1. Tap green "Connect" button on either vehicle
2. Watch connection confirmation messages
3. See status change to "Connected"
4. Notice safety alert buttons become enabled

### **Step 3: Test Manual Safety Alerts**
1. Tap any safety alert button:
   - 🕳️ **Pothole Ahead**
   - 🚧 **Speed Breaker Ahead** 
   - 🚨 **Accident Reported**
2. Watch alert appear locally
3. See alert received on other vehicle
4. Confirm "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle X: [message]"

### **Step 4: Test AI Hazard Detection**
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" button
2. Choose from dialog options:
   - **"Test AI"**: Simulates analysis of sample pothole image
   - **"Camera (Demo)"**: Simulates camera capture and analysis
   - **"Gallery (Demo)"**: Simulates gallery selection and analysis
3. Watch AI analysis messages:
   ```
   System: 📸 Analyzing road image for hazards...
   System: 🤖 AI Detection: 2 hazard(s) found (81% confidence)
   Me: 🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed
   ```
4. See automatic alert transmission to connected vehicle

## 🎯 **AI Detection Demo Flow**

### **Simulation Results**
```
Input: Simulated pothole image analysis
AI Processing: 2 seconds delay (realistic API response time)
Detection: 2 potholes found
Confidence: 80.6% and 70.2%
Alert Generated: "🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed"
Transmission: Automatic if vehicles connected and in range
```

### **Expected Messages**
```
System: 📸 Analyzing road image for hazards...
System: 🤖 AI Detection: 2 hazard(s) found (81% confidence)
Me: 🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed
[Other Vehicle]: ⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle A: 🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed
```
