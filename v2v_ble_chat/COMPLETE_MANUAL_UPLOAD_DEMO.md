- "System: 📊 Processing... 40%"
- "System: 📊 Processing... 60%"
- "System: 📊 Processing... 80%"
- "System: 🤖 Backend AI: X hazard(s) found (nearest: X.Xm)"
- "System: 📡 Source: backend_api"
- Visual results screen opens with distance-labeled bounding boxes
- "System: 📡 V2V Alert sent: [alert with distance]"

On Vehicle B (automatically):
- Receives: "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle A: [hazard] detected X.X m ahead - [action]"
```

### **🎯 Step 3: Backend Test Demo**
```
On Vehicle B:
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" button
2. Select "🕳️ Test Pothole (Backend)"

Expected Results:
- "System: 🧪 Testing pothole detection with backend..."
- "System: 🤖 Backend Test: 2 pothole(s) found (nearest: 1.1m)"
- Visual results screen with test image
- Bounding boxes: "🕳️ potholes 70% (1.1 m)" and "🕳️ potholes 81% (1.2 m)"
- V2V alert: "🕳️ Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead - Reduce speed"

On Vehicle A (automatically):
- Receives: "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle B: 🕳️ Pothole detected 1.1 m ahead - Reduce speed"
```

## 📸 **MANUAL UPLOAD FEATURES**

### **🎮 User Interface**
```
AI Detection Button States:
- Normal: "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" (purple button)
- Processing: "🔄 Processing Image..." (grey, disabled, spinner)
- Complete: Returns to normal state

Dialog Options:
- "📷 Camera Upload" → Opens camera for photo capture
- "🖼️ Gallery Upload" → Opens gallery for image selection
- "🕳️ Test Pothole (Backend)" → Tests with backend API
- "🚧 Test Speed Breaker (Backend)" → Tests with backend API
```

### **📊 Progress Tracking**
```
Upload Progress Messages:
1. "System: 📤 Uploading image to backend for processing..."
2. "System: 📊 Processing... 20%" (file reading)
3. "System: 📊 Processing... 40%" (encoding)
4. "System: 📊 Processing... 60%" (uploading)
5. "System: 📊 Processing... 80%" (backend processing)
6. "System: 🤖 Backend AI: X hazard(s) found (nearest: X.Xm)"
7. "System: 📡 Source: backend_api"
```

### **🎯 Visual Results**
```
Detection Results Screen:
- Original uploaded image displayed
- Red bounding boxes for potholes with "🕳️ potholes X% (X.X m)"
- Orange bounding boxes for speed breakers with "🚧 broken road X% (X.X m)"
- Summary: "🎯 Detection Summary: [hazard] detected X.X m ahead - [action]"
- Confidence and distance information
- Professional automotive-grade interface
```

## 🔄 **FALLBACK SYSTEM**

### **✅ Backend Unavailable Handling**
```
If Backend Not Available:
1. Health check fails automatically
2. "System: ⚠️ Backend unavailable - Using direct API processing..."
3. Seamless fallback to ImageDetectionService
4. Direct Roboflow API processing with distance calculation
5. Results marked as "source: direct_api_fallback"
6. User experience remains uninterrupted
```

### **✅ Error Recovery**
```
Error Scenarios Handled:
- Network timeout → Automatic retry with direct API
- Backend server error → Graceful fallback processing
- Invalid image format → User-friendly error message
- API rate limit → Fallback to cached results
- Connection lost → Retry logic with exponential backoff
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED DEMO RESULTS**

### **📷 Camera Upload Example**
```
User captures road image with pothole:
1. Upload progress: 0% → 100%
2. Backend processes through Roboflow API
3. Distance calculation: Pothole at 1.5m
4. Visual result: Image with red box "🕳️ potholes 85% (1.5 m)"
5. V2V alert: "🕳️ Pothole detected 1.5 m ahead - Reduce speed"
6. Other vehicle receives alert automatically
```

### **🖼️ Gallery Upload Example**
```
User selects existing road image:
1. Image uploaded to backend with progress tracking
2. AI analysis with distance calculation
3. Multiple hazards detected with individual distances
4. Visual results with multiple bounding boxes
5. Nearest hazard prioritized for V2V alert
6. Professional detection summary displayed
```

### **🧪 Backend Test Example**
```
Predefined Test Results:
- Pothole test: 2 detections at 1.1m and 1.2m
- Speed breaker test: 1 detection at 2.7m
- Instant response from backend
- Visual confirmation with test images
- V2V alert transmission to connected vehicle
```
