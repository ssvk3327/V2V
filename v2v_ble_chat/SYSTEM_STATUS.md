## 🎮 **Demo Workflow**

### **Step 1: Verify Connection**
1. Wait for both apps to fully load
2. Check titles show "Vehicle A" and "Vehicle B"
3. Verify range shows ~67m (in range)
4. Confirm "Connect" button is green and enabled

### **Step 2: Manual Connection**
1. Tap "Connect" on either vehicle
2. Watch connection confirmation messages
3. See status change to "Connected"
4. Notice safety alert buttons become colored/enabled

### **Step 3: Test Manual Alerts**
1. Tap any safety alert button (🕳️🚧🚨)
2. Watch alert appear locally
3. See alert received on other vehicle
4. Confirm "⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle X: [message]"

### **Step 4: Test AI Detection**
1. Tap "🤖 AI Hazard Detection" button
2. Choose from dialog options:
   - **"Test AI"**: Analyze sample pothole image
   - **"Camera"**: Take live photo
   - **"Gallery"**: Select existing image
3. Watch AI analysis messages
4. See automatic alert generation if hazards found

### **Step 5: AI Alert Flow**
```
AI Detection → Analysis → Alert Generation → Transmission
"🤖 AI Detection: 2 hazard(s) found (81% confidence)"
"🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed"
"⚠️ ALERT from Vehicle A: 🕳️ Pothole detected ahead - Reduce speed"
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Apps Don't Load**
- Check emulator-5554 and emulator-5556 are running
- Verify Flutter SDK is properly installed
- Run `flutter doctor` to check setup

### **If Server Connection Fails**
- Ensure port 8080 is not blocked
- Check Windows Firewall settings
- Restart server: `node server.js`

### **If AI Detection Fails**
- Verify internet connection for Roboflow API
- Check API key is valid
- Test with Python script: `python test_roboflow_api.py`
